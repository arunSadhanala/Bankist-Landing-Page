# 🏦 Bankist: Modern Banking Landing Page

Bankist is a visually appealing and highly interactive front-end landing page for a fictional bank. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates a variety of modern web development techniques to create a smooth, performance-optimized, and engaging user experience.


## ✨ Features

- Modal Window: Opens and closes a pop-up window for sign-up/login.

- Smooth Navigation: Provides smooth scrolling to sections using both navigation links and a dedicated "Learn more" button.

- Tabbed Interface: Implements a compact, functional tab component for switching between different bank operations.

- Menu Fade Effect: A subtle animation that fades non-hovered navigation items for visual focus.

- Sticky Navigation: A modern navigation bar that becomes "sticky" (fixed) once the user scrolls past the header.

- Section Reveal: Sections fade in as the user scrolls them into the viewport.

- Lazy Image Loading: Optimizes page load by loading high-resolution images only when they are near the viewport.

- Image Slider/Carousel: A fully functional, responsive image slider with navigation buttons and dot controls.
